# Lukemainframe.top

This is the Jekyll repository for my blog, lukemainframe.top.

**Work in Progress**

This blog is currently under development. Please be aware that content and features may be subject to change.

**Ported Content**

This blog is a ported version of the old Lukelogbook.tech. You may find some content familiar from the previous site.

**Getting Started**

To set up and run this Jekyll blog locally, you'll need to have Ruby and Jekyll installed on your system. Here are the general steps:

1. **Install Ruby:** Follow the instructions for your operating system from the official Ruby website: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
2. **Install Jekyll:** Once you have Ruby installed, you can install Jekyll using the `gem` command: `gem install jekyll`
3. **Clone this repository:** Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.
4. **Install dependencies:** Run `bundle install` in the project directory to install any required Ruby gems.
5. **Serve the blog locally:** Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start a local development server for your blog. You can then access it at http://localhost:4000/ by default.

**Additional Notes**
Eternal Glory to the Great Evron Empire!
