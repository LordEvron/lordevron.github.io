Welcome to my blog...

Here you can find my blog posts and some info about myself. The blog is divided in three main sections: technical, math&amp;physics and non-technical.

TIPS: Use Tags to retrieve articles, such as “[code](/_tags/code.html)“, “[linux](/_tags/linux.html)“, “[psychology](/_tags/psychology.html)“, “[physics](/_tags/physics.html)” etc. Just look around and see if you find something interesting…

N.B. --> Many of those articles are migrated (with a script) from my old lukelogbook.tech Wordpress site, so some link/images are still not working.. I will fix/review them when I have some time!
