Welcome to my blog!

Here, I share my thoughts on a variety of subjects, but I'm particularly fascinated by physics, especially astrophysics 
and quantum physics as well as the ever-evolving world of technology, from fundamental chip design to cutting-edge computing.  
I also occasionally delve into the other realms such as psychology.


To help you navigate, I've tagged my articles. Looking for something specific? Try “[code](/_tags/code.html)“, 
“[linux](/_tags/linux.html)“, “[psychology](/_tags/psychology.html)“, “[physics](/_tags/physics.html)”. 
A full list of tags is available at the bottom of this page.


So, take a look around.  I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity and perhaps even challenges your perspective.  Enjoy!


N.B. --> Many of those articles are migrated (with a script) from my old lukelogbook.tech Wordpress site, so some link/images are still not working.. I will fix/review them when I have some time!
