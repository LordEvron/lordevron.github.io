Welcome to my blog...

Here you can find my blog posts and some info about myself. The blog is divided in three main sections: technical, math&amp;physics and non-technical.

TIPS: Use Tags to retrieve articles, such as “[code](/tag/code/)“, “[linux](http://localhost:8080/tag/linux/)“, “[psychology](http://localhost:8080/tag/psychology/)“, “[physics](http://localhost:8080/tag/physics/)” etc. Just look around and see if you find something interesting…

Oh… and I do not have time to proofread my articles, so focus on the content instead…
