## Welcome to my blog!

Here, I share my thoughts on a variety of subjects, but I'm particularly fascinated by physics, especially astrophysics 
and quantum physics as well as the ever-evolving world of technology, from fundamental chip design to cutting-edge computing.  
I also occasionally dive into other realms such as psychology.

You don't know where to start? Here's a reading suggestion: [universe25](/2018/04/25/universe-25-the-fall-of-the-utopian-dream/), 
[kernel and initramfs]( /2022/02/14/pc-boot-process-kernel-and-initramfs/), and [straight lines on a curved surface](/2018/02/19/can-you-draw-a-straight-line-on-a-curved-surface/)



To help you navigate, I've tagged my articles. Looking for something specific? Try “[code](/_tags/code.html)“, 
“[linux](/_tags/linux.html)“, “[psychology](/_tags/psychology.html)“, “[physics](/_tags/physics.html)”. 
A full list of tags is available at the bottom of this page.


So, take a look around.  I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity and perhaps even challenges your perspective.  Enjoy!
