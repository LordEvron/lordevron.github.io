I have a PhD in Nano Technologies and an MSc in Electronics Engineering, which basically means I spent years mastering 
the nanoverse—only to end up wrangling ones and zeros. 
These days, I’m a programmer, data scientist, architect, and, most recently, a SecOps troubleshooter (or ninja, if you prefer).

My real thrill? Bending silicon and software to my will. Whether it's low-level hardware hacking or high-level system design, 
I enjoy making machines do what they were meant to do (or things they probably weren’t).

My digital toolbox:

* Hardware:
    * Familiar with various microcontroller families (STM32 is my go-to)
    * AWS Cloud wizardry (yes, I know it’s not exactly "hardware," but close enough)
    * I also have experience with other clouds—Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean—because why stop at just one?
    * Comfortable with Arduino and Raspberry Pi—especially when making them do things they probably shouldn’t.

* Software:
    * Bilingual in Windows and Linux—because knowing both is a survival skill.
    * Code polyglot: C, C++, Qt, Python, Terraform
    * Speaks fluent Linux (because why fight the machine when you can work with it?)
    * Occasionally dabbles in JavaScript, Go, and Assembly—because understanding the core matters

* Not a fan of fancy interfaces (who needs eye candy when you got code?)

* AI & Data:
    * Trained machine learning models like it was a competitive sport (Keras, TensorFlow, Caffe)
    * Worked with Image recognition - to make computers see the world

* Research:
    * Published a  [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2011/214549) with 218+ citations—basically, academic street cred
    * Check out my useless papers: <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/publications.html">publication list</a>

In short: I break things, build things, and make machines do my bidding. Because knowledge is power—and occasionally, chaos.
