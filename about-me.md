I have studied to master the microverse (PhD in Nano Technologies after MSc. in Electronics Engineering, yeah you read that right) and ended up wrangled of ones and zeros (programmer, data scientist, architect, and recently, SecOps ninja). 

For me the real adrenaline rush comes from bending silicon to my will, a hardware hacker at heart, thriving in the Software ecosystems.

My digital toolbox:

* Hardware:
    * MCU whisperer (STM32 my main squeeze)
    * Can wrangle both Windows and Linux beasts
    * AWS Cloud (if that counts as hardware, right?)
    * and yes I can arduino and RPI too ofc  (**eyerolling**)

* Software:
    * Coding chameleon (C, C++, Qt, Python, Terraform)
    * Linux - speaks the language of the machine
    * Dabbles in JS, Go, and assembly (gotta understand the core)

* Not a fan of fancy interfaces (who needs eye candy when you got code?)

* Data whisperer:
    * Trained machine learning models like they're going out of style (Keras, TensorFlow, Caffe)
    * Worked with Image recognition - to make computers see the world
  
Check out my research: <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/publications.html">publication list</a>

Bragging rights: Published a [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2011/214549) with over 218 citations - boom!

In short, I break stuff, build stuff, and make machines do my bidding. Because knowledge is power...
